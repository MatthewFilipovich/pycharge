Fields 
=======

Monochromatic optical fields are represented using the class, which encapsulates the complex-valued wavefronts sampled on a specified two-dimensional plane.
The class includes methods for modulation and propagation. It also supports a range of methods for field analysis and manipulation, including visualization, normalization, and calculation of the intensity's centroid and standard deviation.
