PyCharge Documentation
==========================

PyCharge is a differentiable electromagnetics simulation library for moving point charges built on JAX.

Key Features
------------

.. grid:: 1 2 2 2
   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item-card:: ⚡️ **Electrodynamics**
      :class-card: sd-bg-light sd-border sd-shadow

      Calculate the relativistically-correct electromagnetic potentials and fields generated by moving point charges.

   .. grid-item-card:: 🔥 **Powered by Jax**
      :class-card: sd-bg-light sd-border sd-shadow

      GPU/TPU acceleration, batch processing, and automatic differentiation.

   .. grid-item-card::  🛠️ **Fully Differentiable**
      :class-card: sd-bg-light sd-border sd-shadow

      Built on JAX, the entire simulation is end-to-end differentiable. Perform gradient-based optimization of physical parameters, or integrate with machine learning models.

   .. grid-item-card:: ⚛️ **Simulations**
      :class-card: sd-bg-light sd-border sd-shadow

      Self-consistent simulations of sources (dipoles, free-charges) driven by the system's electromagnetic fields.
