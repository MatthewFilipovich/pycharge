PyCharge Documentation
======================

PyCharge is a differentiable electromagnetics simulation library for moving point charges built on JAX.

Key Features

.. grid:: 1 2 2 2
   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item-card:: ⚡️ **Point Charge Electrodynamics**
      :class-card: sd-bg-light sd-border sd-shadow

      Compute relativistically-correct electromagnetic potentials and fields generated by moving point charges.

   .. grid-item-card:: ⚛️ **Self-Consistent N-Body Electrodynamics**
      :class-card: sd-bg-light sd-border sd-shadow

      Simulate the dynamics of electromagnetic sources—such as free charges and dipoles—interacting through their self-generated fields.
   
   .. grid-item-card:: 🔥 **Powered by JAX**
      :class-card: sd-bg-light sd-border sd-shadow

      Leverage JAX's just-in-time (XLA) compilation for GPU/TPU acceleration, vectorization, and scalable parallel execution.

   .. grid-item-card:: 🛠️ **Fully Differentiable**
      :class-card: sd-bg-light sd-border sd-shadow

      End-to-end differentiability enables gradient-based optimization, control, and inverse design workflows.
