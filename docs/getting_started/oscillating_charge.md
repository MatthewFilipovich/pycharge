# Oscillating Charge Fields

In the last section we presented a simulation script for calculating the electric field generated by a stationary point charge. Here, we will calculate the fields and potentials generated by an oscillating point charge. The charge is oscillating sinusoidally along the $x$-axis with an amplitude of 0.1 nm and an angular frequency $\omega=5\times10^{17}$ rad/s. To calculate the components of the electric field ($E_x$, $E_y$, $E_z$) generated by the oscillating point charge at time $t=0$ s, we can reuse the Python script from the previous section and instantiate an `OscillatingCharge` object instead of a `StationaryCharge` object:

```python
charge = pc.OscillatingCharge(origin=(0, 0, 0), direction=(1, 0, 0),
                              amplitude=1e-10, omega=5e17)
```

That's it! The output plot is shown below:

Once again, as expected, the $E_z$ field is zero because we are plotting along the $x$-$y$ plane and the charge is oscillating along the $x$-axis.

Next, we can calculate the $\mathbf{B}$ field by replacing the method `simulation.calculate_E` with `simulation.calculate_B`, as well as changing some plot labels throughout the script:

Finally, we can plot the scalar ($\Phi$ or $V$) and vector potentials ($\mathbf{A}$) using the `simulate.calculate_V` and `simulate.calculate_A` methods:
